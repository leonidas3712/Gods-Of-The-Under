# Gods-Of-The-Under
this is a big project I started a long time ago.
its a 2D platformer advanture game that I never finished.
I also went way overboard with tuning the minute aspects of control and movment with pretty musch nothing in the way visuals.
so it feels great, it has a ton of code to its name, but it looks pretty bad.
